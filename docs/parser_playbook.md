## Aria Contract Parsing Playbook

The original doc got unwieldy, so we split it:

1. `docs/parser_overview.md` – mission, scope, data, tooling, config, and how we run experiments.
2. `docs/parser_experiments.md` – run log, coverage snapshot, and which parser we pit against GPT.
3. `docs/parser_strategy.md` – observations, next steps, open todos, master plan, references.

Update the right file when you add context. Each keeps the numbering from the legacy playbook for easy cross-reference.
